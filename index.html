So I wrote this Story to entertain you while my webpage loads!!
<br>
I am loading a lot of images so it might take a while!!
<br>
One day there was a programmer who set out to create the best 
<br>
programmer's text editor in the world! Filled with syntax highlighting, 
<br>
shortcuts, macros, intellisense, build automation, drag and drop UI creation, leading,
<br>
kerning, version control, and any other feature you can think of! For this impossible
<br>
task he sought out the wisest and most experienced programmers in the world! Some said to him,
<br>
"notepad is the best programmer's text editor, you don't need extra features". I said, "Hopefully
<br>
My webpage has loaded by now." I was wrong. So the programmer decided to talk to the newbie programmers 
<br>
about what they wanted in a programmer's text editor. They said they wanted the text editor to turn their
<br>
pseudo code into executable code. I said, "Hopefully My webpage has loaded by now." I was wrong.
<br>
Then the programmer decided that he would design the text editor with the features he wanted because
<br>
after all he wanted to make a programmer's text editor that he though was the best! 
<br>
So he cracked open his books on Design Patterns and Object Oriented Programming and started 
<br>
designing. After 10 years of designing he started implementation. After 10 years of implementation he 
<br>
finally had something presentable! There was an Achilles heel though, a major flaw in the system.
<br>
All the features took too long to load!!! Hopefully my webpage has loaded by now!
<br>
I said, "Hopefully My webpage has loaded by now." I was wrong. So the story continues. The programmer 
<br>
Then spent the next 10 years fixing this flaw. By this time he was tired of working on his project
<br>
and had lost all hope for its completion. He was in complete and utter despair. So he spent his life savings
<br>
to hire a team of the most brilliant programmers in the world to fix his project. The team worked on it night 
<br>
and day until...

The Internet has revolutionized the computer and communications world like nothing before. The invention of the 
<br>
telegraph, telephone, radio, and computer set the stage for this unprecedented integration of capabilities. The 
<br>
Internet is at once a world-wide broadcasting capability, a mechanism for information dissemination, and a medium 
<br>
for collaboration and interaction between individuals and their computers without regard for geographic location. 
<br>
The Internet represents one of the most successful examples of the benefits of sustained investment and commitment 
<br>
to research and development of information infrastructure. Beginning with the early research in packet switching, 
<br>
the government, industry and academia have been partners in evolving and deploying this exciting new technology. 
<br>
Today, terms like "bleiner@computer.org" and "http://www.acm.org" trip lightly off the tongue of the random person 
<br>
on the street. This is intended to be a brief, necessarily cursory and incomplete history. Much material currently
<br>
 exists about the Internet, covering history, technology, and usage. A trip to almost any bookstore will find shelves of
