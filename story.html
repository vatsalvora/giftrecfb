<h1>Loading!</h1>

So I wrote this Story to entertain you while my webpage loads!! I am loading a lot of images<br>
so it might take a while!! One day there was a programmer who set out to create the best <br>
programmer's text editor in the world! Filled with syntax highlighting, shortcuts, macros, <br>
intellisense, build automation, drag and drop UI creation, leading, kerning, version control, and<br>
any other feature you can think of! For this impossible task he sought out the wisest and most<br>
experienced programmers in the world! Some said to him, "notepad is the best programmer's text<br>

programmer's text editor. They said they wanted the text editor to turn their pseudo code into <br>
executable code. I said, "Hopefully My webpage has loaded by now." I was wrong. Then the programmer<br>
decided that he would design the text editor with the features he wanted because after all he wanted<br>
to make a programmer's text editor that he though was the best! So he cracked open his books on Design<br>
Patterns and Object Oriented Programming and started designing. After 10 years of designing he started<br>
implementation. After 10 years of implementation he finally had something presentable! There was an <br>
Achilles heel though, a major flaw in the system. All the features took too long to load!!! Hopefully<br>
my webpage has loaded by now! I said, "Hopefully My webpage has loaded by now." I was wrong. So the <br>
story continues. The programmer Then spent the next 10 years fixing this flaw. By this time he was <br>
tired of working on his project and had lost all hope for its completion. He was in complete and utter<br>
despair. So he spent his life savings to hire a team of the most brilliant programmers in the world to<br>
fix his project. The team worked on it night and day until...
